[x] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was how to think about separating content and design. I used to have some idea of how to separate them, but now my knowledge about the topic is more formalized and enhanced.

The hardest thing in this assignment was trying to figure out the most appropriate tags. For example, I initially thought that the gray bar was supposed to be a <nav>, but I was wrong and it was a header. It was also difficult to figure out where each link went to.
