[x] I solemnly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was learning to use the nano text editor. I liked learning about how it worked and some commands to make the process easier. I also liked learning about how to set up an instance with AWS. 

The hardest thing in this assignment was getting the application to run. I faced some issues with getting the application to work with http. I also faced some trouble with editing the seetings.py file in the nano editor. Additionally, I didn't understand what nohup did at first, but I clarified my doubts with the TA
