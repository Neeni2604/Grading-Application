Homework 2 Cover Sheet
----------------------

In this assignment, I completed:

- [x] Phase 1
- [x] Phase 2
- [x] Phase 3
- [x] Phase 4
- [x] Phase 5

I discussed this assignment with:

- Professor Panchekha
- TAs
- Peers on Piazza

[x] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was flexbox. I liked learning about how to breakdown any layout into smaller chunks that can be recreated using flexbox. I also liked learning about how to debug frontend things using the Chrome Developer Tools. It allowed me to visualize what was going on.

The hardest thing in this assignment was phase 5. I spent a long time trying to figure out how to cap the widths at 50rem. I got it to work once I added a few more HTML elements. Another thing I faced difficulty with was the action cards. It took some time for me to figure out how to get everything aligned properly.
