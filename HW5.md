In this assignment, I completed:

- [X] Phase 2
- [X] Phase 3
- [X] Phase 4
- [X] Phase 5

I discussed this assignment with:

- Professor Panchekha

[X] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was learning to implement security features. I liked learning about how we can block unwanted users from accessing a page and making modifications. I also liked learning about how we can restrict certain file types from being uploaded. 

The hardest thing in this assignment was implementing the pick_grader method. I was having a hard time avoiding selecting every submission to an assignment. I was missing a filter that selected only the submissions to that specific assignment. I discussed it with a TA and I learned how to select only the required submissions.
